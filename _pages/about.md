#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name #your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
#
#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/#about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), #like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

During the day, I am an Electrical Engineer at Apptronik in Austin, TX, where I design advanced power and communication systems for humanoid robots. At night, I am a Stanford M.S. student in Electrical Engineering focused on Deep Learning. My interests span Robotic Learning (including Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Visuomotor Policies, and LVLM for Robotics) and Hardware Design (encompassing Power Electronics, Digital Design, and Motor Control). This combination of robotics work and AI-focused education, coupled with my extensive experience in hardware design from previous roles at Dell Technologies and Boeing, positions me at the forefront of robotics and AI integration.
