Born in Guadalajara, Mexico, and immigrating to Brownsville, Texas, at age 10, my early years were marked by a blend of cultures, a love for sports, and constant learning.

In middle and high school, my passion for robotics, math, and engineering took shape. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in May of 2021 with a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering, a business minor, and high honors. Post-graduation, my journey continued at Dell Technologies, where I've been responsible for the design and development activities associated with electronic designs in platforms with high complexity and new technology ingredients across Dell's lines of business. In August of 2022, acting on a desire to keep abreast of subjects beyond my immediate professional role, I embarked on a part-time M.S. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.

Travel and fitness are integral to my life. Having visited 55 countries across five continents, I embrace the richness of global cultures and perspectives. My dedication to fitness, through daily exercise, is a testament to my belief in nurturing both the mind and the body. My intellectual appetite finds sustenance in podcasts like Huberman Lab, Lex Fridman, and the Tim Ferris Show, covering a spectrum of topics from technology to human physiology.

My life philosophy is centered around self-improvement and positivity. I try to focus my energy, guard my time, train my mind, train my body, think for myself, curate my friends, curate my environment, keep my promises, stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade my world. These are the principles that guide my actions and decisions.

In every step of my journey, from the bustling streets of Guadalajara to the hallowed halls of Stanford, I carry with me a spirit of exploration, a commitment to excellence, and a relentless curiosity that drives me to understand and improve the world around me.
