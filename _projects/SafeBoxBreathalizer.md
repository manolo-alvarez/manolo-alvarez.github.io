<h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
For this project, my colleagues and I developed a lockbox that keeps items locked when a breathalyzer reads an alcohol value that's too high. It's controlled through an app (Blynk) and communicates wirelessly from a phone to the breathalyzer and lock box. I was primarily responsible for formulating the schematics, sourcing the components, PCB design, and integrating the MQ3 sensor with the servo motor used to lock/unlock the box.

We lost access to all documentation for this project shortly after graduation but checkout our final presentation below:
