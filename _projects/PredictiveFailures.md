<h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
In this project, my colleagues and I partnered with ConocoPhilips to address the following questions: <i> </i>, and <i></i>
<ul>
    <li>What production and mechanical parameters are the leading predictors for rod pump failure/downtime?</li>
    <li>What is the best rod-pump design to prevent failures?</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Business Impact</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>An unexpected rod pump outage can drastically reduce production capacity and can significantly increase lifting costs.</li>
    <li>Businesses can use our real-time anomaly detection technology to become aware and proactive of potential repairs when such anomalies are detected.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Solution</b></h4>
Our solution consisted of statistical models using Machine Learning in order to identify, diagnose and predict failures and downtime errors for rod pumps.<br>
