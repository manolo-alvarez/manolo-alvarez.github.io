<h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
For this project, my colleagues and I developed a functioning decentralized voting application on react native that homomorphically and locally encrypted votes, stored them on the interplanetary file system (IPFS), and placed the hash on the Ethereum network. Our PoC won second place in the honors senior design competition within the electrical engineering department at UT Austin. I was primarily responsible for forming the idea, gathering the team, finding us an advisor, leading communication and research efforts, and integrating our solution with IPFS and the Ethereum blockchain.

This is one of my proudest achievements because we were able to incubate and develop the idea to a workable solution without prior knowledge on any of the final technologies applied and a ton of other classes to worry about. In the process, we met with industry experts in cryptography, the president of Ethereum in China, US policy makers, and researchers in state-of-the-art algorithms. We all knew the academic incentive for our effort was low but we found motivation in the belief that we could solve an important issue of the time.

We lost access to all documentation for this project shortly after graduation but checkout our final presentation below:
