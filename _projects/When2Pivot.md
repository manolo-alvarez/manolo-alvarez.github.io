    <b>Overview</b>
</div>
In this project, my colleague and I implemented and attemped to improve on the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in autonomous RL benchmarks by augmenting the action space with a pivot action. Unfortunately, the baseline code was far to buggy for us to implement the code necessary to add the pivot action, in time. In the end, we just hard-coded the pivot after a certain number of steps and analyzed those results.

Despite the technical outcome, it was fun working with a partner and I am appreciative of the learning experience.
