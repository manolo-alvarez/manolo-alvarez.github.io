At 280W of TDP, this one was by far the most powerful PC I got to work on. For this design, I was responsible for developing and assessing ECAD floorplans incorporating the next generation Intel CPU, Nvidia GPU, and our proprietary CAMM memory. I sized the CPU and GPU regulators. And I designed and drove the implementation of our complex lighting architecture across teams.
